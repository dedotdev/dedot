# Getting Started

Install Dedot to your project and start connecting to blockchain networks

## Installation

### Install `dedot` packages

Dedot provides an umbrella package called `dedot`

```bash npm2yarn
npm i dedot
```

Each Substrate-based blockchain has their own set of Data Types & APIs to interact with, so being aware of those Types & APIs when working with a blockchain will greatly improve the overall development experience. Dedot exposes TypeScript's Types & APIs for each individual Substrate-based blockchain, we recommend using TypeScript for your project to have the best experience.

Types & APIs for each Substrate-based blockchains are defined in package [@dedot/chaintypes](https://github.com/dedotdev/chaintypes):

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D @dedot/chaintypes
```

### Typescript setup
Typescript with `moduleResolution: bundlder`

Next, let's connect to Polkadot & Substrate-based chains.

## Connect to network

### Instantiate `DedotClient`
#### Websocket endpoint (`WsProvider`)
```typescript
  import { DedotClient, WsProvider } from 'dedot';
  import type { PolkadotApi } from '@dedot/chaintypes';

  const provider = new WsProvider('wss://rpc.polkadot.io');
  const api = await DedotClient.new<PolkadotApi>(provider);

  // Call rpc `state_getMetadata` to fetch raw scale-encoded metadata and decode it.
  const metadata = await api.rpc.state_getMetadata();
  console.log('Metadata:', metadata);

  // Query on-chain storage
  const balance = await api.query.system.account(<address>);
  console.log('Balance:', balance);
```
#### Smoldot (`SmoldotProvider`)
