# Installation

## Install `dedot` packages

Dedot provides an umbrella package called `dedot`

```bash npm2yarn
npm i dedot
```

Each Substrate-based blockchain has their own set of Data Types & APIs to interact with, so being aware of those Types & APIs when working with a blockchain will greatly improve the overall development experience. Dedot exposes TypeScript's Types & APIs for each individual Substrate-based blockchain, we recommend using TypeScript for your project to have the best experience.

Types & APIs for each Substrate-based blockchains are defined in package [@dedot/chaintypes](https://github.com/dedotdev/chaintypes):

```bash npm2yarn
npm i -D @dedot/chaintypes
```

## Typescript setup
Typescript with `moduleResolution: bundlder`

Next, let's connect to Polkadot & Substrate-based chains.
