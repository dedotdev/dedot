     * The list of thresholds separating the various bags.
     *
     * Ids are separated into unsorted bags according to their score. This specifies the
     * thresholds separating the bags. An id's bag is the largest bag for which the id's score
     * is less than or equal to its upper threshold.
     *
     * When ids are iterated, higher bags are iterated completely before lower bags. This means
     * that iteration is _semi-sorted_: ids of higher score tend to come before ids of lower
     * score, but peer ids within a particular bag are sorted in insertion order.
     *
     * # Expressing the constant
     *
     * This constant must be sorted in strictly increasing order. Duplicate items are not
     * permitted.
     *
     * There is an implied upper limit of `Score::MAX`; that value does not need to be
     * specified within the bag. For any two threshold lists, if one ends with
     * `Score::MAX`, the other one does not, and they are otherwise equal, the two
     * lists will behave identically.
     *
     * # Calculation
     *
     * It is recommended to generate the set of thresholds in a geometric series, such that
     * there exists some constant ratio such that `threshold[k + 1] == (threshold[k] *
     * constant_ratio).max(threshold[k] + 1)` for all `k`.
     *
     * The helpers in the `/utils/frame/generate-bags` module can simplify this calculation.
     *
     * # Examples
     *
     * - If `BagThresholds::get().is_empty()`, then all ids are put into the same bag, and
     * iteration is strictly in insertion order.
     * - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 64`, and the thresholds are determined according to
     * the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is equal to 2.
     * - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 200`, and the thresholds are determined according to
     * the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is approximately equal to 1.248.
     * - If the threshold list begins `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, then an id with score 0 or 1 will fall
     * into bag 0, an id with score 2 will fall into bag 1, etc.
     *
     * # Migration
     *
     * In the event that this list ever changes, a copy of the old bags list must be retained.
     * With that `List::migrate` can be called, which will perform the appropriate migration.
